# 🧠🔐 Autonomous Cyber Defense System (ACDS)

An **industry-grade, self-learning Autonomous Cyber Defense System** that observes system behavior, detects cyber threats, autonomously responds, and continuously improves using Reinforcement Learning.

This project is designed to simulate a **real-world SOC-grade autonomous defense platform**, not a theoretical or academic-only system.
